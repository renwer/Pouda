Yet another pet project to get a solid grasp of socket programming in Java.
In short, this is a chat room with minimalistic client GUI, written in JavaFX, and multithreaded server.
No frameworks or external libraries used.

Feel free to clone and use it as a skeleton for client-server applications based on sockets (That's what I'll do, anyways).
